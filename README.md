|  0 | 2022-06-21 | Brian              | AN AMAZING MACHINE!!! AWESOME COFFEE!!!                                            | Ok, I am going to try to split this into two sections- the short review and an extended review. The short review: It is AMAZING and well worth the expense. Buy good beans and you are good to go. The longer review: First of all, this machine is expensive so I would look for any sort of sale. For us, it was worth it. The expense: At time of purchase this was going for roughly $799, but in terms of value it was worth it for us. Looking at our Starbucks bill, we spent well over that in just a few months because we would go there each morning and sometimes on the way home from work. We haven’t visited Starbucks at all since we bought this machine so it has more than paid for itself, and that is including the purchase of good beans. Starbucks was always a hit and miss depending on who was making our coffee each morning, but the Barista Touch has been a hit because once you create your settings it is always the same AND you can make micro adjustments until you get it just right (see “Features” below). The quality: It is very well made and the touch screen makes this a breeze to use- sooooooo easy. It has a drip tray that is very easy to empty and clean. The froth wand is easy to use and makes perfect frothed milk without any hassle at all. The tamper, it was good but not great so we opted for a spring loaded tamper and purchased a grind distributor which made using this even easier. If you have never tamped coffee, it can be tricky but using a spring tamper just made it so much easier however the tamper included is perfectly fine. We purchased the Sccody 53mm Calibrated Espresso Tamper which makes espresso tamping a breeze without any guesswork needed. The Barista Touch does come with a "blade" distributor, but I opted to buy a better one which has made for perfect coffee. We bought the Gurudar 53mm Coffee Distributor which is also a palm tamper but we just use it for the distribution of the grind instead of using the included Breville blade- again the included blade is good butr we wanted something a bit easier to use. Both the Sccody and the Gurudar are perfect additions and take all the guess work out of learning to make espresso, but there are many other options and even using what is included with the Touch you will be good to go with a small learning curve. The features: First, the touch screen- the Barista Touch comes with a screen that makes it so easy to create your coffee of choice. It has preprogrammed options (which are adjustable) and it allows you to custom build your coffee of choice and assign it an icon. In fact, everything is icon based and it even has a tutorial built in. For instance, if you want to make a latte, press the latte icon and a screen pops up with the easy to follow steps. You can make many different types of coffee including Americanos, Cappuccinos, and even simple espresso shots. You can even custom design your coffee, then assign it an icon, then every time you want that coffee you just hit the icon and follow the steps. Blamo- great coffee every time. Second great feature-the grinder. It has a built-in grinder which makes all the difference. The grinder is adjustable so you can change the grind size to fit your needs and to customize your coffee (fine or coarse grind). Next good feature- the water tank. It holds a good amount of water and is located at the back of the machine. You just have to watch the level but it will give you a “water tank is empty” message on the screen when you need to refill it. The downside: The only real thing we found to be a problem is the grinder and changing beans. We decided to try a different brand of coffee to see if we liked it but the hopper was full. Removing the beans from the hopper was a bit tricky and I know there is probably some short cut, but we managed and honestly it wasn’t that big of a deal. Comparisons: Our first espresso machine, the De’Longhi 15 bar espresso maker, was a good beginning machine but just isn’t as good as the Barista Touch. The De’Longhi didn’t have a grinder so we used pre ground coffee which was ok, just not super good and certainly not good enough to keep us from returning to our Starbucks habit. Our kid ended up taking it to college, so we upgraded to the touch. One thing that has made a world of difference, besides the included grinder, is the automatic milk frother on the Barista Touch. Super easy to use and is as simple as placing the milk pitcher, which is included, under the wand but it has to sit on a temp sensor to work accurately. We haven’t had a single problem with it to date. You can also use the frother in manual mode if you want, which is a great added feature but the automatic mode is good enough to make latte Art…that is if you know how to actually make latte art unlike me. As for adjustability, you can adjust how much coffee is ground, how fine you want the grinds, and how long the machine grinds the coffee. You can adjust the temp of the milk froth, you can go from automatic to manual mode to froth the milk so there are several options to adjust and fine tune to your exact specification. Overall, we love the Barista Touch- it makes amazing coffee. Of course, the beans have a great deal to do with it but still this machine rocks. UPDATE: Ok, I did find one tiny aspect of this most excellent machine that Breville could fix, aside from the price, and that is the frothing wand. Once you finish frothing the milk you have to clean the wand. It does a self clean, but when it self cleans the wand does not line up directly with the hole in the drain pan. ours is off a slight bit. The drain pan hole should be just a bit larger and that would fix everything. We found that after cleaning the wand we put the damp paper towel or rag near the base of the wand on the drain pan to avoid splashes. not a big deal but thought you should know. |        5 |
|  1 | 2022-07-01 | Charles W.         | UPDATE: Breville support fixed everything!                                         | NEW UPDATE: August 2022 was able to reach out to Breville support and they sent a replacement unit! I was pretty upset that my two month old espresso machine broke (what I believe happened after a bit of troubleshooting/cleaning was the bottom of the grinder had a stem/post that broke or came loose where and the grinder was just free spinning). I tried to live chat with an agent but no luck there so I opened a support case on the website, uploaded some photos, and then called them instead. Hold time was estimated at an hour so I did the option to get a call back and they called back within the quoted time frame. The agent I spoke with Alice J. and she was extremely professional and helpful. I got no hassle from them about the issue I was having and before my call was over I had multiple emails with a shipping label and all the instructions on what I needed to send back. It used a UPS VIP product return service that confused the young lady at my UPS store but they did accept it using Breville's clear instruction sheet (I didn't need to box up the old machine at all I just took all the accessories off and taped the cord down). I was advised that they would either repair my machine in 5-7 days or ship me a replacement. It has only been 7 days and my replacement unit was delivered today! What a pleasant surprise to have it show up so promptly. I hope whatever the defect that happened with my pervious machine doesn't happen with this one! We loved our Barista Touch up until it broke and it was an investment that we really want to have last for a long, long time. UPDATE: Bought June 2022 now it's August 2022, so two months of operation. I made a cup of cappuccino this morning and it worked fine, I made a second cup and it stopped grinding beans halfway through even with a full hopper of beans. I went through the arduous steps of cleaning the burr grinder (yes, tools are involved) and I vacuumed out a ton of coffee dirt but even after all of that the grinder makes noise but fails to grind beans. After just two months this is unacceptable to have it just not function anymore. I am still trying to get an email back from Breville support so I'll update this review if they are able to resolve the problem. Still the fact I have to deal with this in the first place means I am never going to enjoy this machine as much as I had been this thing is NOT cheap. ---------------- My wife and I got a taste for good cappuccino when we went to Europe last year so for our anniversary we went ahead and got our own espresso machine. The reason I went for the Breville Barista Touch was that there were some glowing reviews online that made me feel it was a good fit. We never had a coffee appliance like this before so we didn't have a grinder, we didn't know how to froth milk, and the measurements for a good shot were beyond us. This machine does it all, it grinds very well, extraction is good and the automatic milk frother is the star of the show. It fits well under our cabinets, too! Now we have delicious cappuccino every day and it's finally fun to make coffee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |        4 |
|  2 | 2022-06-19 | Ricardo A. Seneris | The more you know about espresso machines the more you'll appreciate this machine. | The first espresso machines I've tried were all Brevilles: 2 Barista Express' and a Barista Pro. I did return all of them before the 30 day return period to Amazon. I thought they were not working properly. After a few weeks, I purchased a Lelit Victoria. Big mistake. It does not froth milk "properly" or because I don't know how? So, I put it away for almost a year and I switched back to my dependable drip coffee machine the Technivorn Moccamaster. However, I keep up with what are the latest espresso machines on the market and their reviews, including the "poor" Breviiles. The Breville reviews are mostly positive. I thought I'll give a Breville machine one more try. I was leaning toward buying a Barista Express again or the dual tank Breville. Honestly, I don't think I did Breville justice in any of my evaluations. This time I chose the Barista Touch, instead, due to its automatic and manual milk frothing, whichever you choose. I'm sorry, Breville, I was wrong about your machines. All I can say now is Wow. This machine will be hard to beat on performance and price point! This may be the last espresso machine I'll be using until it goes haywire. Milk frothing is outstanding. BTW, most reviewers on the Brevilles that use a 54mm portafilter failed to explain the differences between the "pro" 58mm and the "non-pro" 54mm portafilter. The 54mm Breville portafilter can handle up to 21mg of grounds without touching the grouphead screen. The 54mm and the 58mm have the same total coffee ground capacities. End of the story on that. The tamper is excellent as it is. Get a grind distribution tool called WDT, instead. You don't need a fancy one tamper. I tested the built-in grinder and did the optimum ground for my brew and It works great, but it's hard to do a single dosing. Since I already have a Eureka Specialita grinder, this is what I prefer to use for single dosing. More repeatable grinds and less waste of fresh grounds. Lastly, the Barista Touch has a regulated grouphead pressure within the "accepted" best pressure of 9-9.5 Bars. I would highly recommend this machine or the the Barista Pro with manual knobs to save yourself a few hundred bucks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |        5 |
|  3 | 2022-08-21 | Jonathan Locke     | First personal espresso machine, some missed expectations                          | Dislikes: - Water tank grows things. I anticipated this, and am sure the manual must recommend frequent cleanings, but if you're waiting for the fancy digital touchscreen to remind you, you'll be sorely mistaken. I might have to throw out water more frequently and scrub it down (weekly?), but that's way too high maintenance for a parent with a toddler. - The waste water/grounds container is made of plastic and shows wear and tear very fast (weeks) on a $1000 machine. Unfortunately, this is a high touch area as one is always sliding the milk frothing cup and mugs in and out. - The auto-clean feature on the steam milk wand is annoying. Auto-cleaning by pouring milk and water to the water catch bin is a recipe for some nasty smelling stuff, unless you're constantly cleaning it. Or, you use something to catch the rinse water and pour it out. I'd rather just manually clean it myself, but I can't find a way to disable this feature.

 0 | 2022-06-21 | Brian              | AN AMAZING MACHINE!!! AWESOME COFFEE!!!                                            | Ok, I am going to try to split this into two sections- the short review and an extended review. The short review: It is AMAZING and well worth the expense. Buy good beans and you are good to go. The longer review: First of all, this machine is expensive so I would look for any sort of sale. For us, it was worth it. The expense: At time of purchase this was going for roughly $799, but in terms of value it was worth it for us. Looking at our Starbucks bill, we spent well over that in just a few months because we would go there each morning and sometimes on the way home from work. We haven’t visited Starbucks at all since we bought this machine so it has more than paid for itself, and that is including the purchase of good beans. Starbucks was always a hit and miss depending on who was making our coffee each morning, but the Barista Touch has been a hit because once you create your settings it is always the same AND you can make micro adjustments until you get it just right (see “Features” below). The quality: It is very well made and the touch screen makes this a breeze to use- sooooooo easy. It has a drip tray that is very easy to empty and clean. The froth wand is easy to use and makes perfect frothed milk without any hassle at all. The tamper, it was good but not great so we opted for a spring loaded tamper and purchased a grind distributor which made using this even easier. If you have never tamped coffee, it can be tricky but using a spring tamper just made it so much easier however the tamper included is perfectly fine. We purchased the Sccody 53mm Calibrated Espresso Tamper which makes espresso tamping a breeze without any guesswork needed. The Barista Touch does come with a "blade" distributor, but I opted to buy a better one which has made for perfect coffee. We bought the Gurudar 53mm Coffee Distributor which is also a palm tamper but we just use it for the distribution of the grind instead of using the included Breville blade- again the included blade is good butr we wanted something a bit easier to use. Both the Sccody and the Gurudar are perfect additions and take all the guess work out of learning to make espresso, but there are many other options and even using what is included with the Touch you will be good to go with a small learning curve. The features: First, the touch screen- the Barista Touch comes with a screen that makes it so easy to create your coffee of choice. It has preprogrammed options (which are adjustable) and it allows you to custom build your coffee of choice and assign it an icon. In fact, everything is icon based and it even has a tutorial built in. For instance, if you want to make a latte, press the latte icon and a screen pops up with the easy to follow steps. You can make many different types of coffee including Americanos, Cappuccinos, and even simple espresso shots. You can even custom design your coffee, then assign it an icon, then every time you want that coffee you just hit the icon and follow the steps. Blamo- great coffee every time. Second great feature-the grinder. It has a built-in grinder which makes all the difference. The grinder is adjustable so you can change the grind size to fit your needs and to customize your coffee (fine or coarse grind). Next good feature- the water tank. It holds a good amount of water and is located at the back of the machine. You just have to watch the level but it will give you a “water tank is empty” message on the screen when you need to refill it. The downside: The only real thing we found to be a problem is the grinder and changing beans. We decided to try a different brand of coffee to see if we liked it but the hopper was full. Removing the beans from the hopper was a bit tricky and I know there is probably some short cut, but we managed and honestly it wasn’t that big of a deal. Comparisons: Our first espresso machine, the De’Longhi 15 bar espresso maker, was a good beginning machine but just isn’t as good as the Barista Touch. The De’Longhi didn’t have a grinder so we used pre ground coffee which was ok, just not super good and certainly not good enough to keep us from returning to our Starbucks habit. Our kid ended up taking it to college, so we upgraded to the touch. One thing that has made a world of difference, besides the included grinder, is the automatic milk frother on the Barista Touch. Super easy to use and is as simple as placing the milk pitcher, which is included, under the wand but it has to sit on a temp sensor to work accurately. We haven’t had a single problem with it to date. You can also use the frother in manual mode if you want, which is a great added feature but the automatic mode is good enough to make latte Art…that is if you know how to actually make latte art unlike me. As for adjustability, you can adjust how much coffee is ground, how fine you want the grinds, and how long the machine grinds the coffee. You can adjust the temp of the milk froth, you can go from automatic to manual mode to froth the milk so there are several options to adjust and fine tune to your exact specification. Overall, we love the Barista Touch- it makes amazing coffee. Of course, the beans have a great deal to do with it but still this machine rocks. UPDATE: Ok, I did find one tiny aspect of this most excellent machine that Breville could fix, aside from the price, and that is the frothing wand. Once you finish frothing the milk you have to clean the wand. It does a self clean, but when it self cleans the wand does not line up directly with the hole in the drain pan. ours is off a slight bit. The drain pan hole should be just a bit larger and that would fix everything. We found that after cleaning the wand we put the damp paper towel or rag near the base of the wand on the drain pan to avoid splashes. not a big deal but thought you should know. |        5 |\n|  1 | 2022-07-01 | Charles W.         | UPDATE: Breville support fixed everything!                                         | NEW UPDATE: August 2022 was able to reach out to Breville support and they sent a replacement unit! I was pretty upset that my two month old espresso machine broke (what I believe happened after a bit of troubleshooting/cleaning was the bottom of the grinder had a stem/post that broke or came loose where and the grinder was just free spinning). I tried to live chat with an agent but no luck there so I opened a support case on the website, uploaded some photos, and then called them instead. Hold time was estimated at an hour so I did the option to get a call back and they called back within the quoted time frame. The agent I spoke with Alice J. and she was extremely professional and helpful. I got no hassle from them about the issue I was having and before my call was over I had multiple emails with a shipping label and all the instructions on what I needed to send back. It used a UPS VIP product return service that confused the young lady at my UPS store but they did accept it using Breville\'s clear instruction sheet (I didn\'t need to box up the old machine at all I just took all the accessories off and taped the cord down). I was advised that they would either repair my machine in 5-7 days or ship me a replacement. It has only been 7 days and my replacement unit was delivered today! What a pleasant surprise to have it show up so promptly. I hope whatever the defect that happened with my pervious machine doesn\'t happen with this one! We loved our Barista Touch up until it broke and it was an investment that we really want to have last for a long, long time. UPDATE: Bought June 2022 now it\'s August 2022, so two months of operation. I made a cup of cappuccino this morning and it worked fine, I made a second cup and it stopped grinding beans halfway through even with a full hopper of beans. I went through the arduous steps of cleaning the burr grinder (yes, tools are involved) and I vacuumed out a ton of coffee dirt but even after all of that the grinder makes noise but fails to grind beans. After just two months this is unacceptable to have it just not function anymore. I am still trying to get an email back from Breville support so I\'ll update this review if they are able to resolve the problem. Still the fact I have to deal with this in the first place means I am never going to enjoy this machine as much as I had been this thing is NOT cheap. ---------------- My wife and I got a taste for good cappuccino when we went to Europe last year so for our anniversary we went ahead and got our own espresso machine. The reason I went for the Breville Barista Touch was that there were some glowing reviews online that made me feel it was a good fit. We never had a coffee appliance like this before so we didn\'t have a grinder, we didn\'t know how to froth milk, and the measurements for a good shot were beyond us. This machine does it all, it grinds very well, extraction is good and the automatic milk frother is the star of the show. It fits well under our cabinets, too! Now we have delicious cappuccino every day and it\'s finally fun to make coffee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |        4 |\n|  2 | 2022-06-19 | Ricardo A. Seneris | The more you know about espresso machines the more you\'ll appreciate this machine. | The first espresso machines I\'ve tried were all Brevilles: 2 Barista Express\' and a Barista Pro. I did return all of them before the 30 day return period to Amazon. I thought they were not working properly. After a few weeks, I purchased a Lelit Victoria. Big mistake. It does not froth milk "properly" or because I don\'t know how? So, I put it away for almost a year and I switched back to my dependable drip coffee machine the Technivorn Moccamaster. However, I keep up with what are the latest espresso machines on the market and their reviews, including the "poor" Breviiles. The Breville reviews are mostly positive. I thought I\'ll give a Breville machine one more try. I was leaning toward buying a Barista Express again or the dual tank Breville. Honestly, I don\'t think I did Breville justice in any of my evaluations. This time I chose the Barista Touch, instead, due to its automatic and manual milk frothing, whichever you choose. I\'m sorry, Breville, I was wrong about your machines. All I can say now is Wow. This machine will be hard to beat on performance and price point! This may be the last espresso machine I\'ll be using until it goes haywire. Milk frothing is outstanding. BTW, most reviewers on the Brevilles that use a 54mm portafilter failed to explain the differences between the "pro" 58mm and the "non-pro" 54mm portafilter. The 54mm Breville portafilter can handle up to 21mg of grounds without touching the grouphead screen. The 54mm and the 58mm have the same total coffee ground capacities. End of the story on that. The tamper is excellent as it is. Get a grind distribution tool called WDT, instead. You don\'t need a fancy one tamper. I tested the built-in grinder and did the optimum ground for my brew and It works great, but it\'s hard to do a single dosing. Since I already have a Eureka Specialita grinder, this is what I prefer to use for single dosing. More repeatable grinds and less waste of fresh grounds. Lastly, the Barista Touch has a regulated grouphead pressure within the "accepted" best pressure of 9-9.5 Bars. I would highly recommend this machine or the the Barista Pro with manual knobs to save yourself a few hundred bucks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |        5 |\n|  3 | 2022-08-21 | Jonathan Locke     | First personal espresso machine, some missed expectations                          | Dislikes: - Water tank grows things. I anticipated this, and am sure the manual must recommend frequent cleanings, but if you\'re waiting for the fancy digital touchscreen to remind you, you\'ll be sorely mistaken. I might have to throw out water more frequently and scrub it down (weekly?), but that\'s way too high maintenance for a parent with a toddler. - The waste water/grounds container is made of plastic and shows wear and tear very fast (weeks) on a $1000 machine. Unfortunately, this is a high touch area as one is always sliding the milk frothing cup and mugs in and out. - The auto-clean feature on the steam milk wand is annoying. Auto-cleaning by pouring milk and water to the water catch bin is a recipe for some nasty smelling stuff, unless you\'re constantly cleaning it. Or, you use something to catch the rinse water and pour it out. I\'d rather just manually clean it myself, but I can\'t find a way to disable this feature.
